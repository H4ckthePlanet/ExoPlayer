NOTE
PTS Wrap occurs after 1 day, 2:30:43.717677.  These timestamps are
over 11 days so they have wrapped many times.  The cue time values do not overlap
once un-wrapped the timestamp values are offset a reasonalbe distance from LOCAL time
which is required to be non-monotonic to PTS

NOTE start un-wrapped 1:32:02.778 end is 1:32:04.062

266:39:19.955 --> 266:39:21.239
